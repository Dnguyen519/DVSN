4. **Color**: Ensure images match your brand aesthetic
5. **Lighting**: Prefer golden hour or soft natural light

## Alternative Free Image Sources

If you don't have your own photos, consider these sources:

1. **Unsplash** (unsplash.com)
   - Search: "Toronto Islands", "Distillery District Toronto", etc.
   
2. **Pexels** (pexels.com)
   - Good for Toronto skyline and landmark shots
   
3. **City of Toronto Archives** (toronto.ca/archives)
   - Historical and contemporary Toronto images

## Implementation

Once you have the images:

1. Create the directory structure:
   ```
   images/
   └── locations/
       ├── toronto-islands.jpg
       ├── distillery-district.jpg
       ├── high-park.jpg
       ├── casa-loma.jpg
       ├── harbourfront.jpg
       └── trinity-bellwoods.jpg
   ```

2. The engagement page is already configured to use these image paths
3. If images are missing, a dark gradient fallback will be displayed

## Custom Photography Tips

For the best results, consider hiring a photographer to capture these locations:
- Morning light works best for most locations
- Avoid crowds by shooting early or on weekdays
- Include some shots with couples to show scale
- Capture both wide establishing shots and detail shots
